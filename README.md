# Notes on expert’s communities 

## Communities vs Work Groups
Sustainable, long living communities are based on personal relationships, member’s common expertise, interests. Tactical objectives, working groups serve as a fuel for the community. 
Thru the participation in short-lived working groups employees get a chance of proving themselves as professionals and build social connections. Working groups are the gates into expert’s communities.
Communities have flat structure. Members migh ask one another for assistance regardless of company’s ranks. Personal favors are common. People are willing to spend their free time together. 

Working groups are focused on some narrow, completable objective. Objective could require a variety of skills, roles. Work group will be able to benefit to communities only if there is at least two members with expertise on which community is focused on.

## Moderation of Communities
Moderation is focused on social activities, transparency and work group organization.

Tools that enable collaboration on the community level:
•	Chat room
•	Wiki

### Social Activities
Workshops, leisure activities. Anything that enforces collaboration. 
Could be driven by socially active members. Incentives, including financial ones, might be considered.

### Transparency
Community activities should be as transparent as possible. Potential members should be able to see the outcome that community produces, events, schedule. History of work groups activities along side with planned ones will help to staff them.
Note: Public access to current in-progress activities and meeting notes might be a sensitive topic and needs to be agreed upon internally. 
All notable success stories should be publicly communicated. This will:
•	Attract new community members
•	Provide the recognition and gratitude for the current members

Possible formats: presentation, article on the intranet or short summary on public TVs.

### Work Groups
Both sides – community members and company management might provide objectives for work groups.
Pre-assigned budget will help to negotiate people schedule inside their main projects.

## Moderation of Work Groups
 
### Context
Participation is free. 
Potential members come from single company, premises, but different projects. Members can spend a limited time on work group activities (0-2 hours per week). 
People are brought together from different projects in order to:
•	Work on some goal unrelated to specific company project;
•	Create cross-projects social connections;
•	On-board new people into existing communities.

### Social Aspects
Members need to feel that their involvment matters. 
Each participant, at any time, should be able to pick an individual short-lived, completable task. 
The team needs to have experts that are able to assist with declared operational targets.

Interpersonal relationships are more important than tactical goals. Objectives come and go, people stay.

Members need to be confident that their work will be accepted with fair, benevolent attitude. Personal effort should be recognized and accepted with gratitude.

Members should not be pressured into tasks fulfilments. In case there is a lack of involvement, general aspects of the work group should be revised.

### Processes
Members should have access to the past, current and planned work group activities. 
This is especially important due to the fact that some members might miss gatherings because of:
* High load in their main projects
* Shifted schedule
* Lack of objectives that would match their skills/preferences 

Tools that need to be present:
* Wiki
* Issue tracker
* Shared calendar

Things to track:
* Meeting minutes
* Schedule, list of upcoming events 
* Topics for the next meeting
* Task assignments, progress
